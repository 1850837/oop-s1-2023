change: decided to make use terminal-based user interface instead of graphical user interface 
justification: terminal based ui was chosen as it is simpler to implement and would not require additional time to be spent on deveoping and 
maintaining the graphical interface. We determined that it would allow us to focus primarily on the gameplay and mechanics of the game. It would 
also be helpful in debugging, with clear textual output being generated.
