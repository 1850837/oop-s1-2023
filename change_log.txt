change: decided to make use terminal-based user interface instead of graphical user interface 
justification: terminal based ui was chosen as it is simpler to implement and would not require 
additional time to be spent on deveoping and maintaining the graphical interface. We determined
that this change would allow the Farm class to only hold what a farm would, while the Textbased
class would handle the input and output. It would also be helpful in debugging, with clear 
textual output being generated.

change: in changing the above, it was decided that there would be three arrays in the Farm class that 
represent the visual display in the Textbased class. The relevant functions were put in the Farm class
to accomodate this change.
justification: it was decided that it made more sense to have this part of the visuals calculated
in the Farm class, before being processed in the Textbased class, as this made the Textbased class neater
and more compact, as this is the class that should just be printing and calling functions with the
user's input.
